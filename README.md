# HDL Projects
Verious HDL Projects that I will do, am doing, and have done...

# Game of Life (Completed)
This project implemented Conway's Game of Life which includes 4 modes:
 - Normal: User manually send an input to update to the next generation
 - Automatic: board automatically advances to next generation at regular intervals
 - User Input: User can toggle a cell's state using a cursor that can be controlled
 - Init: initializes the board with a preloaded pattern

Some changes can be made to the project in order to:
 - wraparound borders
 - make it scalable

# Something needs to change
 - Figure out a solution to organize this mess that is Vivado's project file structure
 - beautify the README file some day...
